# Designing-an-integrated-management-system-for-shared-spaces


In this project, we have created a comprehensive system for managing physical shared spaces in libraries, designed to maximize resource utilization and enhance user experience. This system focuses on streamlining operations and making access to various services easier for users.

### Key Features:
- **Space Reservation**: Allows for easy booking of study rooms, halls, and meeting spaces with real-time availability tracking, automated notifications, and prevention of double-bookings to optimize space utilization.

- **Equipment Management**: Enables reservation and management of essential equipment, like projectors and laptops, along with inventory tracking and maintenance scheduling to ensure equipment availability and performance.

- **Library Management**: An integrated system for borrowing and returning books, with catalog updates, overdue alerts, and a history view of personal borrowings.

- **Course and Workshop Scheduling**: Manages registration, scheduling, and attendance tracking for courses and workshops, including distribution of materials to encourage ongoing learning and engagement.

- **Food Reservation**: Integrates with the food court or library caf√© to allow food ordering and reservation, with options for delivery to reserved spaces or at specified times.

The goal of this system is to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges of managing shared spaces and creates a productive, collaborative environment for all users.
